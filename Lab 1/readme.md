# 🍔 Global Purchasing Power Parity Analysis via the Big Mac Index

## Objective

This project applies the **Law of One Price** to real-world data by leveraging "Burgernomics"—using Big Mac prices across countries as a standardized basket of goods to test whether exchange rates reflect true purchasing power parity.

## Methodology

- **Data Construction**: Manually engineered a structured dataset using Python dictionaries, ingesting Big Mac price data from The Economist's 2015 global survey across multiple currencies
- **PPP Calculation**: Computed implied purchasing power parity exchange rates by comparing local Big Mac prices to the US benchmark price
- **Currency Valuation Analysis**: Calculated percentage over- or undervaluation of each currency relative to the US Dollar, identifying deviations from theoretical exchange rate equilibrium
- **Data Manipulation**: Utilized Pandas for systematic data transformation, ensuring reproducible and scalable analysis workflows
