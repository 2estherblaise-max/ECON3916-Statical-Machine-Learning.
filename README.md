# 📊 Economic Data Science Portfolio

Welcome! I'm Esther, a sophomore at Northeastern University pursuing dual degrees in Business Administration and Economics with a concentration in Finance. This repository showcases my journey in **ECON 3916: Statistical & Machine Learning for Economics**, where I'm learning to bridge traditional economic theory with modern data science techniques.

## 🎯 About This Portfolio

This collection represents my exploration of the intersection between economics and machine learning. Through this coursework, I'm developing skills that combine:

- **Causal Inference**: Understanding *why* economic relationships exist and how policy interventions create real-world impacts
- **Predictive Analytics**: Leveraging machine learning to forecast outcomes and identify patterns in complex economic data
- **Scalable Thinking**: Taking foundational statistical concepts (like OLS regression) and extending them with modern ML algorithms (like Lasso, Ridge, and ensemble methods)

My goal is to demonstrate how economic intuition and computational tools work together to solve meaningful problems in data analysis, economic consulting, and finance.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each folder in this repository contains labs, problem sets, and projects that demonstrate the "Concept Extension" methodology—starting with classical econometric foundations and scaling up to machine learning applications.

## 🚀 What I'm Learning

- Regularization techniques (Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net) for high-dimensional economic data
- Cross-validation and model selection strategies
- Causal inference frameworks alongside predictive modeling
- Real-world applications in labor economics, finance, and policy analysis

## 📫 Connect With Me

I'm actively seeking opportunities in **data analysis, economic consulting, and finance** where I can apply these skills to drive data-informed decision-making. Feel free to explore my work and reach out!
